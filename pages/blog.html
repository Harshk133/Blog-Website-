                            <p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a critical service in modern networking. It
                                automates the process of assigning IP addresses and other network configuration
                                parameters to devices on a network. While many routers and network appliances come with
                                built-in DHCP servers, you may want to set up your own DHCP server for more control,
                                flexibility, and customization. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the steps to
                                set up your own DHCP server on a Linux-based system.</p>
                            <p>Step 1: Choose Your DHCP Server Software
                                There are several DHCP server software options available for Linux, with two of the most
                                popular being:
                                ISC DHCP Server: This is a widely used DHCP server that is well-documented and
                                supported. It's a good choice for beginners.
                                Dnsmasq: Dnsmasq is a lightweight DHCP and DNS server that's easy to configure. It's
                                suitable for small to medium-sized networks.
                                For this guide, we'll use the ISC DHCP Server. You can install it on your Linux system
                                using your distribution's package manager. For Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, use:
                            </p>
                            <b><code>sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server</code></b>
                            <p>For Red Hat-based systems like CentOS, use:</p>
                            <b><code>sudo yum install dhcp</code></b>
                            <p>Step 2: Configure the DHCP Server
                                After installing the DHCP server software, you'll need to configure it to suit your
                                network. The main configuration file for the ISC DHCP Server is typically located at
                                /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf. Use a text editor to open this file with superuser privileges:</p>
                            <b><code>sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</code></b>
                            <p>Here's a basic example of a DHCP configuration file:</p>
                            <b><code>subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
                                range 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200;
                                option routers 192.168.1.1;
                                option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;
                                option domain-name "example.com";
                              }
                              </code></b>
                            <p>In this example, we've defined a DHCP subnet with a range of IP addresses to assign, the
                                default gateway (router), DNS servers, and a domain name. Customize these settings
                                according to your network requirements.
                                Step 3: Start and Enable the DHCP Server
                                Once you've configured the DHCP server, you need to start and enable it to run at boot.
                                Use the following commands:</p>
                            <b><code>sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-server
                                sudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-server
                                </code></b>
                            <p>For Dnsmasq, you would start and enable it similarly:</p>
                            <b><code>sudo systemctl start dnsmasq
                                    sudo systemctl enable dnsmasq</code></b>
                            <p>Step 4: Configure Network Interfaces
                                Now that your DHCP server is up and running, you'll need to specify which network
                                interface(s) it should listen on. Edit the DHCP server configuration file at
                                /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server:</p>
                            <b><code>sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server</code></b>
                            <p>And specify the interface(s) like so:</p>
                            <b><code>INTERFACES="eth0"</code></b>
                            <p>Replace "eth0" with the name of your network interface.

                                For Dnsmasq, you can specify the interface(s) in the /etc/dnsmasq.conf file.

                                Step 5: Firewall Rules (if necessary)

                                Depending on your system's firewall settings, you might need to open the DHCP port (UDP
                                67) to allow DHCP requests. Use your system's firewall management tools to configure
                                this rule.

                                Step 6: Testing

                                To test your DHCP server, connect a client device (e.g., a computer or smartphone) to
                                the network and ensure it's set to obtain an IP address automatically. It should receive
                                an IP address within the range you specified in the configuration file.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Setting up your own DHCP server on a Linux system can provide you with greater control
                                over your network's IP address allocation and configuration. Remember to regularly
                                review and update your DHCP server's configuration to meet the changing needs of your
                                network. DHCP servers play a crucial role in network management, ensuring that devices
                                can seamlessly connect and communicate within your network.</p>

                        overstated. Libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras have solidified Python's position
                        as
                        the preferred language for AI research and development.<br>

                        Python's allure lies in its simplicity, versatility, and vibrant community. Whether you're a
                        novice
                        or an experienced developer, Python has something to offer. Its gentle learning curve, combined
                        with
                        powerful capabilities, makes it a programming language that can take you from your first "Hello,
                        World!" to building complex, real-world applications and contributing to cutting-edge
                        technology. If
                        you haven't already, it's time to dive into the world of Python programming and unlock its
                        endless
                        possibilities. Happy coding!

                <div id="collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the
                        collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes
                        control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can
                        modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting
                        that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition
                        does limit overflow.
